The potential applications of gold nanocages with various environmental and surface conditions were investigated based on the ability to tune the localized surface plasmon resonance modes to a series of desired wavelengths and bandwidths. Collaboration with the Albert group (Department of Electronics) was carried out with the successful assembly, as well as limit of detection and sensitivity improvements, of a protein biosensor\nsupported on a titled fibre Bragg grating. Investigations into the fluorescence quenching effects of silica-capped gold nanocages was carried out using a tailored selection of fluorescent dyes to enable potential enhancement and/or quenching using the same nanostructure. The optical properties of gold nanocages allow for many potential uses of the same nanostructure in a wide variety of applications, including biomedical and biosensing applications.", "contributor": [], "thesis_degree_name": "Master of Science: (M.Sc.)", "pdf_url": "https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/8a303a64-624e-4016-8762-cdd0004a0d52/etd_pdf/a25b389065d5d0617dc6f4157d0eddaf/staff-examiningthegildedcagesynthesisopticalproperties.pdf", "zip_url": "https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/8a303a64-624e-4016-8762-cdd0004a0d52/etd_supplemental_files/bb64f25d0194e9da7c4860c0c7f8b514/staff-examiningthegildedcage-supplemental.zip", "pdf_md5_hash": "a25b389065d5d0617dc6f4157d0eddaf", "zip_md5_hash": "bb64f25d0194e9da7c4860c0c7f8b514"},

These two legal concepts became conflating as they relied on race to be actualized, and they provided (or at the very least supported) the definition of race as a distinguishing factor between different classes of humans. The human that informs human rights was always meant to be European, male, Christian, and white. The property that informs property rights was meant to be everyone else who existed within that space and could be exploited to benefit those who can claim human  rights (those who can be grouped with the humans who inform human rights). They did not mean the same thing, but they did the same thing by actualizing racial segregation in the Americas.", "contributor": [], "thesis_degree_name": "Master of Arts: (M.A.)", "pdf_url": "https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/4a3ff5f5-ef4a-4923-8f12-535a730eff3d/etd_pdf/75083ed3ce0acaa8ef8c3b55d423d3c7/lunianga-humanrightsaspropertyrights.pdf", "zip_url": [], "pdf_md5_hash": "75083ed3ce0acaa8ef8c3b55d423d3c7", "zip_md5_hash": []},

This thesis presents investigations, developments, and implementations of trajectory planning algorithms to automate trajectory design. This thesis first develops custom CAD/CAM software called the Planar Computer Automated Trajectory (PCAT) planning algorithm to establish baseline performance. Trajectory planning is next automated using the novel Planar Image-Space Trajectory (PIST) planning algorithm, which uses computer vision alone to generate  machining trajectories. The PIST algorithm is completely automated, with no required CAD data of the workpiece, adapting to new workpieces or manufacturing imperfections. The feasibility of the PIST algorithm is investigated through robotic deburring experimentation, where it successfully deburred the sheet metal parts. The PIST algorithm proved to be the preferred candidate over the PCAT algorithm, as it provided an indistinguishable resulting surface finish while reducing the setup time.", "contributor": [], "thesis_degree_name": "Master of Applied Science: (M.App.Sc.)", "pdf_url": "https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/87520c16-49cf-4e05-a4f7-58587e94936a/etd_pdf/a42165204364608fe272fd3f8a12eacd/macmillan-trajectoryplanningforcontourfollowingandrobotic.pdf", "zip_url": [], "pdf_md5_hash": "a42165204364608fe272fd3f8a12eacd", "zip_md5_hash": []}
